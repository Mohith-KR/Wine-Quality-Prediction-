For this project, I used ML algorithms on Red Wine Quality dataset to build various classification models to predict whether a particular red wine is “good quality” or not. Each wine in this dataset is given a “quality” score between 0 and 10. For the purpose of this project, I converted the output to a binary output where each wine is either “good quality” (a score of 7 or higher) or not (a score below 7). The quality of a wine is determined by 11 input variables: Fixed acidity Volatile acidity Citric acid Residual sugar Chlorides Free sulfur dioxide Total sulfur dioxide Density pH Sulfates Alcohol

Objectives

The objectives of this project are as follows: To experiment with different classification methods to see which yields the highest accuracy To determine which features are the most indicative of a good quality wine
